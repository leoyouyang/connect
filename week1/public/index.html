        <h1>Last Sunday</h1>
        <p>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunch time.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside.</p>
        <p>"What a day!" I thought. "It's raining again."</p>
        <p>Just then, the telephone rang.</p>
